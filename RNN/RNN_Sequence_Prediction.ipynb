    "# SEQUENCE PREDICTION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of only pitches, we would like to include other aspects of music in our model.\n",
    "These include:\n",
    "* note lengths\n",
    "* Rests\n",
    "This is the only way to create rhythms that make the generated music more interesting.\n",
    "We still limit ourselves to piano midi files, which can contain two tracks due to the notation of the two hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to keep the LSTM architecture, because LSTM is ideally suited for sequences.\n",
    "Therefore we thought a lot about the music decoding.\n",
    "Thus, the relevant information should be kept in as few parameters as possible.\n",
    "To do this, we developed the following ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Music rasterization\n",
    "A grid is placed over the music with a resolution greater than the measure (e.g., an eighth note). At each point in this grid, we consider whether a note is struck or held.\n",
    "Thus, note lengths and rests are encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advantages:\n",
    " * Output is one-dimensional\n",
    " * Low complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disadvantages:\n",
    " * Some notes are not considered in this grid because they are faster (e.g. 1/16 or triplets).\n",
    " * High complexity in pre-processing\n",
    " * Simultaneous notes have to be encoded/decoded as chords\n",
    " \n",
    "This idea was not pursued further due to the high complexity in pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Difference (TD) focused approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The Temporal Difference is the temporal distance between the attack of two successive notes.\n",
    "For this purpose, each Global Offset of all notes in a piece of music was assigned the notes played at that time.\n",
    "Thus, the two piano voices could be combined into one.\n",
    "Since there can be notes of different length in the voices at one time, the length is stored together with each note.\n",
    "An element of this TD-list is coded like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[temporal_difference,[[pitch, duration], [pitch, duration], ...]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM must receive a uniform input. So the list of pitches must always be the same length. For this reason we have padded the list with empty elements up to a certain length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attempt to encode music in this form one-hot failed.\n",
    "A vector of this type has a length of about 14,000, which is unsuitable for training.\n",
    "Instead of hot encoding, TD lists could be output directly. However, the floats contained in them are not generated precisely enough and therefore cannot be mapped directly to the target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments exist on this idea, but they are not presented in this notebook. The reduction of this approach provides the best result and is therefore part of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduction of the TD-focused approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension problem of the previous approach is solved by splitting the TD lists.\n",
    "Thus, the new input to the network is to consist of a sequence of lists of 3 elements each. Each of these lists contains the distance to the next note (TD), the duration as well as the pitch.\n",
    "This way, multiple notes can still be played at the same time, since the TD is 0 in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    " * Dimensions are greatly reduced compared to the previous approach.\n",
    " * Several notes can be played at the same time and with different lengths\n",
    " * Different distances between notes are possible\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The parameter `sequence_length` must not be chosen too small. In an experiment with length 24 (v2), continuous loops of the same melodies or patterns occurred, since the training data also repeated at this length.\n",
    "* A larger Sequence Length lengthens the training significantly.\n",
    "* We expect a multidimensional output from the network, matching the input. For this reason, we have added another reshape layer to the architecture.\n",
    "* The longer we train the mesh, the more it adapts to the training data. As a result, you get almost identical training data as output. So the mesh can easily overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "* Subfolders results_RNN contain checkpoints of some tests with different parameters. The config.txt describes the configuration for the respective network. In addition, a notebook for the respective test is deposited. Since the training takes extremely long in each case, we could train only few variants.\n",
    "* **Experiment V0**: The network is to be trained with only one piece of music. The goal is to test the basic functionality. By long training and a small dropout rate of 0.1 the loss shall be reduced to a minimum, which means strong overfitting. The output of the network is therefore very similar to the input.\n",
    "* **Experiment V1**: The network was trained on several pieces of music by one composer. The architecture was slightly enlarged and the `sequence_length` was increased to 140.\n",
    "* **Experiment V2**: The network was trained on several pieces of music by one composer. The `sequence_length` was significantly reduced with a value of 24. The result from this experiment sounds best. To avoid repetitive melodies the `sequence_length` can be increased for the generation. \n",
    "* **Experiment V3**: Trained with a mean `sequence_length` of 100 on several pieces of music by a different composer than in the previous trials. The number of parameters that can be learned is decreased.\n",
    "* **Experiment V4**: In experiment v4, we put all the training songs in the same key. The expectation is that the generated music sounds more harmonic and the input space is reduced. Contrary to our expectation, we need much more time for training. The result has also deteriorated significantly."
