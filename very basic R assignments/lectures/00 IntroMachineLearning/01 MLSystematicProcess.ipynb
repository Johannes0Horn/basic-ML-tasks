    "`Important:` In many Machine Learning context you have to minimize (rarely maximize) a so called **loss-function** which is mostly for a single training example or a **cost-function** which is over the entire training set. Sometimes it is also used in the same manner. We want to use in these lectures the name loss-function. Both are used to get best fit for the model. **Best fit of model** means that the differences between the true observed value and the predicted values are small. The loss-function measures how close the predicted values are to their corresponding true observed values. There are different automatic and by hand ways to adapt the model to minimize (rarely maximize) that loss-function. We will see this if we speak about that algorithm.\n"
